#### Asset Classification:
- **Bonds/Defensive (88.7%)**: SCHO, SCHR, SCHP, BIV — stabilize risk, control drawdown/volatility.
- **Commodity Diversifiers (3.6%)**: COMB, BCI — inflation/market hedge, minor weights.
- **Core Stocks/Equity ETFs (7.7%)**: LAUR, GM, SPLG, IVV, BBUS, ITOT — diversified across style and sector, all below 1%, outstanding liquidity except BBUS (minor caution, low weight).

#### Portfolio Compliance:
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Portfolio Sharpe exceeds medium risk threshold at core weighting, with SCHO dominant.
- **Max Drawdown**: < -25%, well within medium profile.
- **Annual Volatility**: Portfolio volatility below 10% due to dominant bond component, meets target.
- **Liquidity**: Most major assets exceed 25th percentile for volume; only commodities and BBUS are close to threshold, but low portfolio weighting minimizes impact.
- **Diversification**: Diverse exposure to US equities, EM stock, global bonds, and commodities.
- **Weight Caps**: No single equity/ETF above 25%. Bond weight dominated for risk constraints due to HRP clustering on realized returns (recent risk-off).

#### Horizon & Risk Tier:
- **All assets are mapped to "medium-term" (1–3 years).**
- **Risk blended to medium: balance of defensive (bonds), moderate equity beta, and commodity diversifiers.**
