**Conclusion:**  
This analysis provides asset-by-asset compatibility for a medium risk, medium-term portfolio.

Assets with flagged governance/high overall risk (F, UAL, GCT, NECB, OPFI) should only feature as small, tactical positions to not unbalance the risk profile, and require ongoing monitoring for adverse developments. These selections offer a solid foundation across sectors, supporting both growth and resilience in a medium-term context.
