**Major Market-moving Trend Deviations:**
- US GDP contraction.
- Euro Area returns to GDP growth with record trade surplus, rate cut.
- China: Persistent deflation, decelerating growth; major monetary easing.
- Employment generally stable, but risks building for future weakness if manufacturing PMIs stay below 50.
- Global fiscal backdrops remain stretched â€” risk if growth does not recover.
- Inflation recedes, opening door for further policy easing globally.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The global macroeconomic picture presents mixed signals: European growth recovers, the US enters contraction, and China struggles with deflation/weak manufacturing. Downside growth risks are prominent; inflation and policy cycles are turning dovish. Financial markets remain resilient for now, but macro headwinds warrant close monitoring of early-warning indicators.
