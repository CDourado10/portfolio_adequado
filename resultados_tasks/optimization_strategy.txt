Based on the specified parameters of a medium risk level and a medium-term investment horizon, the optimal portfolio optimization strategy is the Balanced Efficient Frontier approach.

Here is the documented analysis and rationale for the chosen strategy:

1. **Risk Level and Horizon Identification**: The investor's profile requires a medium risk level and a medium-term horizon, which suggests a need to balance return expectations with acceptable levels of volatility and drawdown.

2. **Review of Medium Risk Strategies**: The eligible strategies for medium risk as outlined are:
   - **Balanced Efficient Frontier**
   - **Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP)**
   - **Critical Line Algorithm (CLA)**

3. **Strategy Comparison**:
   - **Balanced Efficient Frontier**: This classical approach constructs a set of portfolios that optimize the trade-off between expected return and risk, typically measured by portfolio variance or standard deviation. It enables the investor to choose a portfolio that best matches their targeted medium risk level within the efficient set of possibilities, and suits a medium-term horizon by providing flexibility and clear decision boundaries.
   - **Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP)**: This method focuses on allocating risk equally across hierarchical clusters of assets, leading to diversified and robust portfolios. While HRP is highly effective at reducing concentration risk and tail events, it tends to be most advantageous for investors particularly concerned with hidden correlations and market instability.
   - **Critical Line Algorithm (CLA)**: CLA is designed to generate the efficient frontier for portfolios under various constraints, particularly useful when minimizing tracking error and adhering to strict asset allocation boundaries. While powerful for constrained problems, it is most utilized when tracking a benchmark is a primary goal.

4. **Strategy Selection Rationale**:  
The Balanced Efficient Frontier is best suited for investors with a medium risk appetite and a medium-term horizon as it:
   - Directly targets the core trade-off between risk and return, aligning with medium risk objectives.
   - Offers a clear visualization of portfolio choices, making it easier to select the optimal allocation at the desired risk-return point.
   - Provides flexibility to adjust for the medium-term outlook, allowing integration of anticipated market changes while maintaining the risk preference.
   - Is well-established and widely adopted for its effectiveness and transparency, which is valuable for both performance monitoring and communication with stakeholders.

**Conclusion and Documentation**:  
The Balanced Efficient Frontier has been selected as the portfolio optimization strategy for this investor profile. This choice ensures an appropriate balance of return and risk in accordance with medium risk tolerance and a medium-term investment horizon. The rationale is grounded in the superior suitability of the Efficient Frontier approach for articulating and achieving targeted portfolio outcomes within these constraints. This decision is documented for reference and ongoing performance evaluation.
