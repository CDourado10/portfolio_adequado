**Rationale & Documentation:**
- **Diversification:** The allocation blends major fixed income (high weight for stability), global broad equity ETFs, and select large-cap leaders for return potential.
- **Volatility Control:** Dominant allocation to bonds ensures medium risk is maintained even if equities correct.
- **Return Potential:** Exposure to global equities (US and international ETFs, large caps like MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, BRK-B) captures upside.
- **Alternative Hedge:** Moderately-sized gold position for inflation/volatility hedge.
- **Rebalancing:** Quarterly, which is suitable for risk management and long enough to capture medium-term trends.
- **Allocation Weights:** Min 2%, max 10% for any single holding (except concentrated bond ETFs due to their risk profile).
- **Metrics:** Strong Sharpe ratio (1.77) indicates returns well-compensate for risk.

**Summary:**  
This portfolio construction aligns perfectly with a medium risk, medium-term profile, blending stability from bonds with calculated growth exposure to equities, real estate, and gold. Turnover is controlled and allocations maintain broad sector, geographical, and asset class diversity.
