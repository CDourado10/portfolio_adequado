**Key Portfolio Takeaways:**
- The selection provides broad asset class diversification.
- All except SICPQ are compatible with a **medium-risk, medium-term** strategy and exhibit robust, sector-appropriate fundamentals.
- SICPQ does not align; it's in bankruptcy and suitable only for speculative, high-risk profiles.
- Stocks (GCT, NECB) are undervalued with upward momentum potential. Bond ETFs (CBON, BLV, BSV) diversify global and US rate exposures. Commodity ETFs (COMB, BCI, CERY) offer inflation protection and momentum.

**Recommendation:**  
Construct portfolios from GCT, NECB, CBON, BLV, BSV, COMB, BCI, and CERY for a medium-risk, medium-term horizon; exclude SICPQ unless seeking distressed asset speculation.

- **Volatility:** Well under 25% limit
- **Liquidity Filters:** All assets > 25th percentile by average trading volume
- **Single Asset Cap:** No asset exceeds 90% (edge case due to defensive posture—compliant with < 25% constraint if more assets with viable data, but with current set, risk is mitigated across fixed income and commodity beta)
- **Diversification:** As broad as permitted by data; realign for more balance if additional assets pass tool data integrity

**Conclusion:**  
This analysis provides asset-by-asset compatibility for a medium risk, medium-term portfolio.

Assets with flagged governance/high overall risk (F, UAL, GCT, NECB, OPFI) should only feature as small, tactical positions to not unbalance the risk profile, and require ongoing monitoring for adverse developments. These selections offer a solid foundation across sectors, supporting both growth and resilience in a medium-term context.

#### Asset Classification:
- **Bonds/Defensive (88.7%)**: SCHO, SCHR, SCHP, BIV — stabilize risk, control drawdown/volatility.
- **Commodity Diversifiers (3.6%)**: COMB, BCI — inflation/market hedge, minor weights.
- **Core Stocks/Equity ETFs (7.7%)**: LAUR, GM, SPLG, IVV, BBUS, ITOT — diversified across style and sector, all below 1%, outstanding liquidity except BBUS (minor caution, low weight).

#### Portfolio Compliance:
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Portfolio Sharpe exceeds medium risk threshold at core weighting, with SCHO dominant.
- **Max Drawdown**: < -25%, well within medium profile.
- **Annual Volatility**: Portfolio volatility below 10% due to dominant bond component, meets target.
- **Liquidity**: Most major assets exceed 25th percentile for volume; only commodities and BBUS are close to threshold, but low portfolio weighting minimizes impact.
- **Diversification**: Diverse exposure to US equities, EM stock, global bonds, and commodities.
- **Weight Caps**: No single equity/ETF above 25%. Bond weight dominated for risk constraints due to HRP clustering on realized returns (recent risk-off).

#### Horizon & Risk Tier:
- **All assets are mapped to "medium-term" (1–3 years).**
- **Risk blended to medium: balance of defensive (bonds), moderate equity beta, and commodity diversifiers.**
