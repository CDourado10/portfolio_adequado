## Performance Metrics
Projected returns and performance metrics were derived from historical data:
- Average expected annual returns from selected stocks range from 8% to 12%.
- ETFs are expected to yield moderate returns in line with market performance.
- High yield bonds are projected to provide a yield of around 3-5%, contributing to portfolio stability.

### Summary of Projected Returns
| Asset Type              | Expected Return (%) |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Stocks                 | 10%                 |
