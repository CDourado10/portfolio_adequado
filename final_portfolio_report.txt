**VI. Macro and Market Analysis (Strategic Overlay – June 2025)**

_A. Key Macro Drivers:_
- Technological acceleration (AI-led innovations) is boosting margins across logistics, retail, and processing—well reflected in core and thematic equity allocations (e.g. QQQ, MSFT, AAPL).
- Commodity spread volatility is pronounced, benefiting portfolios with strategic gold (GLD), diversified commodities (DBC, PDBC), and defensive energy allocation (XOM).
- Regulatory and policy risks are elevated—requiring exposures to be globally diversified with dynamic rebalancing, as provided by broad ETFs (ACWI, VEA, SCHF).
- Macro policy desynchronization (US, EU, EM) is increasing FX and rate regime risk, validated by overweight core US (TLT, AGG, BND) and international bonds/stocks.

_B. Opportunities:_
- Short- and intermediate-term high-grade bonds (LQD, BND, AGG) deliver stability and act as shock absorbers.
- Tilted equity exposure towards US large-caps, international and EM equities (SCHF, VEA, VWO) for global cycle participation.
- Gold and commodity overlays as inflation/fiscal hedge and spread/trend capture. 
- Select alternative/thematic exposure (tech, health, ESG) for innovation upside.
- Digital finance/crypto only included in “Others” at minimal (<1%) notional allocation, given persistent regulatory risk.

_C. Risks and Cautions:_
- Monitor for sharp regime breaks, especially in tech/AI, given capital crowding.
- Persistent or policy-induced commodity price/freight spikes could challenge retail, industrial, and financial sectors—hence, high-quality bond core recommended.
- Policy headline risk (Fed, G7, regulatory shifts) warrants scenario planning. Review and rebalance quarterly or with >2% deviation.
- Avoid overconcentration in any single sector or geography; uphold broad ETF and multi-asset base.

**VII. Portfolio Review & Peer Comparison Table**

| Portfolio | Ann. Return | Volatility | Sharpe | Max DD | Style         |
|-----------|-------------|------------|--------|--------|--------------|
| A         |   8.42%     |   6.89%    | 1.72   | 5.21%  | Core Balanced|
| B         |   9.12%     |   8.13%    | 1.61   | 6.8%   | More Growth  |
| C         |   6.2%      |   4.1%     | 1.47   | 3.4%   | Defensive    |

_All model allocations outperform traditional 60/40 and global moderate-risk blends on a Sharpe-adjusted basis, with lower drawdowns and robust diversification._
