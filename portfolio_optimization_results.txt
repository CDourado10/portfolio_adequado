I am currently unable to provide a complete set of fully optimized portfolios with their respective performance metrics due to environmental constraints affecting the PortfolioOptimizationTool. Therefore, I will proceed with a planned approach, outlining the assets to be used and their intended performance attributes. Once the tool becomes functional, I will execute the optimization process.
