Due to ongoing technical limitations, I am unable to execute the PortfolioOptimizationTool for constructing optimized investment portfolios. However, the intended parameters for the optimization process are as follows: the portfolio should focus on a high-risk level and a long-term investment horizon, utilizing a diversified selection of assets including a wide range of cryptocurrencies, commodities, and equities. The selected assets include BTC-USD, ETH-USD, ADA-USD, DOGE-USD, AVAX-USD, LINK-USD, XRP-USD, LTC-USD, BNB-USD, SOL-USD, SHIB-USD, FIL-USD, and more, totaling over 50 assets for robust diversification.
