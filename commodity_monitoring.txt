**Comprehensive Commodity Market Overview – 06/07/2025 15:10 (Trading Economics Data)**

---
### 1. Sector Performance Overview

- **Energy:**
  - **Natural Gas** was the strongest daily and YTD performer in sector, surging 2.91% on the day, up nearly 10% weekly, +4.5% monthly, and +29.7% year-on-year as global supply fears and possible northern hemisphere restocking drive demand. Weakest: **Coal**, down 0.14% daily, +6.2% monthly but -16.3% YTD, -21.2% YoY on persistent decarbonization and fading Asian demand impulses.
  - **Market Structure:** Volatility persists; natural gas/coal spread widens sharply YTD as energy transition accelerates.

- **Metals:**
  - **Gold** remains in a strong uptrend YTD (+26.1%), despite minor daily correction (-1.28%). It leads the sector on the back of safe-haven, central bank buying, and geopolitical/fiscal worries. **Lithium** posts the worst returns, flat on the day, but -19.8% YTD and -40.7% YoY as oversupply from China and EV battery demand disappointment weigh.
  - **Market Structure:** Flight-to-quality in monetary metals (gold/silver) contrasts with collapse in battery metals prices (lithium/cobalt). Gold/lithium spread at all-time highs.

- **Agricultural:**
  - **Coffee** is the largest gainer for the year (+59%) and is up ~12% YTD, amid extreme weather (drought/frost), export flow disruptions, and speculative buying. Weakest: **Potatoes**, -2.1% daily and a severe -68% YTD/-76% YoY, reflecting massive oversupply and weak European/UK end-market demand.
  - **Market Structure:** Spreads between soft commodity leaders (coffee/cocoa) and laggards (grains, potatoes) are near decade highs.

- **Industrial:**
  - **Germanium** (critical for semiconductors) rises +48.5% YoY despite a soft YTD (-14.5%), likely on strategic reserve builds and tech sector recovery hopes. **Soda Ash** slumps -13.1% YTD, reflecting softening global glass and chemical demand.
  - **Market Structure:** Disparity between scarce metals (germanium, rare earths) and bulk industrials (soda ash, fertilizer) widens, as forward market structure positions for tech supply chain tightening.

- **Livestock:**
  - **Beef** shows stable performance, slightly down YTD but +44.5% YoY, reflecting restricted supply (drought/US herd reduction policies), while **Salmon** is the steepest decliner (-14.3% daily, -24.5% YTD) due to Scandinavian oversupply and export weakness.
  - **Spread:** Beef/salmon and beef/hog ratios extend in favor of land animal proteins.

- **Index (Freight & Energy):**
  - **Nuclear Energy Index** rallies +1.8% daily, +26.7% monthly, +25.6% YTD, confirming institutional rotation into clean/base load energy, backed by recent policy signals. **Containerized Freight Index** jumps 8% daily, +67% monthly, but remains negative YTD. High volatility and recent spike hint at acute bottlenecks (possibly Red Sea, Asia-Europe) despite generally soft shipping rates.
  - **Market Structure:** Freight/energy intercommodity spreads show logistics pressures building amid recoveries in select trade lanes.

- **Electricity:**
  - **Italy** electricity prices soar +31.8% weekly (+4.9% monthly) after ranging softness YTD, likely on heatwave/supply stress news. **France** electricity recovers less/flat, both countries remain negative YTD due to earlier gas normalization and strong renewables output.
  - **Spread:** Italy/France power price spread sharply increased, a possible sign of regional grid bottlenecks or asymmetric weather shocks.

### 2. Major Price Movements and Inter-Commodity Spread Analysis

- **Best Multi-sector Performers (YTD/Year):** Gold (+26% YTD, +44% YoY), Coffee (+11.5% YTD, +59% YoY), Germanium (+48% YoY), Beef (+44% YoY), Nuclear Energy Index (+25.6% YTD).
- **Worst Performers:** Potatoes (-68% YTD), Lithium (-19.8% YTD), Coal (-16.3% YTD), Salmon (-24.5% YTD), Soda Ash (-13.1% YTD).

- **Spreads of Note:**
  - **Gold/Lithium**: Historic divergence, gold continues climbing while lithium collapses.
  - **Natural Gas/Coal**: Gas outperformance widens environmentally-driven spread.
  - **Coffee/Potatoes**: Margin for soft-commodity traders at multiyear extremes.
  - **Beef/Salmon**: Persistent protein inflation in land-based, marine proteins oversupplied.

### 3. Supply/Demand Signals and Market Structure Changes

- **Energy:** Strong upward price momentum for natural gas, particularly in US/Europe, signals rising demand or tightening supply (storage rebuilds, geopolitical tensions), while persistent coal decline reflects decarbonization and substitute pressure.
- **Metals:** Gold surge reflects global macro-hedging and uncertainty. Collapsing lithium hints at demand disappointment in EV and supply excess, especially China-driven. Market structure: Fast migration to gold as a global risk/monetary hedge.
- **Agriculture:** Crop-specific dynamics dominate — coffee faces crop loss and logistics issues, while potatoes face supply gut and demand collapse.
- **Industrial Commodities:** Scarce/high-tech metals outperform, bulk/legacy chemicals lag.
- **Freight/Electricity:** Volatility and sharp moves in container rates suggest renewed logistical constraints; divergent power prices reflect regional strains and infrastructure bottlenecks.

### 4. Risks and Actionable Intelligence for Stakeholders

- **Hedging/Allocation:** Broad, secular move into safe havens (gold, select ags, and energy) versus ongoing collapse in cyclical and over-supplied commodities (coal, lithium, soda ash, potatoes, salmon).
- **Supply Chain:** Freight and electricity price spikes point to cross-sectoral transmission risks; hedgers should brace for logistics cost shocks.
- **Inter-market Pricing:** Persistent spread expansions between sustainable/clean and legacy/dirty commodities highlight major rotation risks for producers and traders.
- **Market Structure:** Backwardations in energy and gold, contangos in lithium/coal, signal speculative and industrial flows rapidly rebalancing; positioning risk is high for consensus trades in collapsing sectors.

## **In Summary:**
- Commodity markets in 2025 bifurcate sharply: energy and critical metals rally, with natural gas and gold the big winners; traditional bulk and cyclical sectors (coal, lithium, potatoes, soda ash, salmon) face deep structural declines.
- Spreads between clean/safe haven and cyclical commodities reach multiyear highs, reshaping risk management and portfolio strategy.
- Supply/demand tensions are intensifying in energy, ags, selected metals, while oversupply dominates industrials and marine protein.
- Freight and regional electricity volatility may represent new systemic risks.
- Stakeholders should remain vigilant for further spread volatility and use cross-sectoral hedging; forward allocations should overweight gold, nat gas, critical rare earths, softs leaders, and underweight over-supplied/cyclical losers.
