The exploration of high-risk cryptocurrencies for a short-term investment horizon using the AssetExplorationTool would yield a comprehensive structured list of assets. This would typically include notable names such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ethereum (ETH-USD), and multiple other high-risk options like Solana (SOL-USD), Cardano (ADA-USD) etc. However, I am unable to provide a specific list with the requested criteria without access to the exploration results from the tool.
