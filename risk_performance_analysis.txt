4. **Risk Adjustment for Long-Term Investment Horizon**
   - The metrics calculated above have been evaluated for consistency with a long-term investment perspective. 
   - The expected return aligns with a long-term growth objective, although the volatility indicates a higher risk than the portfolio's annualized return suggests.
   - The Sharpe Ratio of 0.30 reflects reasonable risk-adjusted returns, but does indicate the potential for further optimization.

These metrics collectively provide insight into the performance expectations of the portfolio. They suggest that while the expected return is in line with long-term investment goals, adjustments might be necessary to better manage volatility and improve the overall risk-adjusted performance, particularly for a higher-risk tolerance investor.
