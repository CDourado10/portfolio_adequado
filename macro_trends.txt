Trends Report: Key Macroeconomic Indicators – Trends, Change Points, Patterns, and Correlations (Week of June 9-14, 2024)

1. US Inflation Rate (YoY and MoM, CPI) – May

Identified Trends:
- Headline CPI has stabilized at 3.4% YoY over the past two months (Mar/Apr), with an expected continuation at 3.4% in May. MoM readings have consistently moderated: from 0.4% (Mar) to 0.3% (Apr), with an expectation of further moderation to 0.1% in May.
- Core CPI is also holding near 3.5% YoY, with minor deceleration expected.

Change Points:
- No sharp inflection point observed in YoY rates, but the significant deceleration in the monthly trend this May, if realized (0.1% MoM), would mark the first clear downward shift since late 2023.

Relevant Patterns:
- Inflation appears “sticky” at levels moderately above the Fed’s 2% target but shows a persistent absence of fresh acceleration.
- MoM readings are increasingly the leading indicator for market expectations of policy shifts and asset allocations.

Observed Correlations:
- Stable or softer CPI readings (especially if both headline and core MoM meet/subcede estimates) show high positive correlation with risk asset rallies (S&P 500, NASDAQ), USD depreciation, and Treasury yield decreases.
- Close relationship with US PPI (as leading), and strong co-movement with Core CPI and PCE trends.

2. G7 Summit

Identified Trends:
- Regular pattern of transient market volatility around major global summits, with outsized FX and commodity moves during periods of geopolitical focus (e.g., war, sanctions).

Change Points:
- Market reaction is nonlinear—price discovery shifts rapidly upon any sign of coordinated fiscal or sanctions action.

Relevant Patterns:
- Coordination or pronounced statements on global policy (trade, Ukraine, inflation) are historically linked to safe-haven flows (USD, JPY) and commodity price spikes.

Observed Correlations:
- Oil/gold and FX volatility indices spike on hawkish or sanction-related commentary.
- Broader equity indices (global and US) react most strongly to pocketed themes (trade, stimulus hints).

3. US Initial Jobless Claims – Week of June 7

Identified Trends:
- Slow but steady climb from 215k (mid-May) to projected 225k (current week); this represents the mildest labor softening since early 2023.
- Still well below the 250k-300k threshold historically associated with material labor market weakening or recession risk.

Change Points:
- No major break yet, but the “four-week moving average” is now ticking up, indicating a potential prelude to broader labor market cooling.

Relevant Patterns:
- Sustained claims at/above 230-240k, if paired with weaker payroll/growth releases, historically precede “risk-off” corrections or a bond rally.

Observed Correlations:
- Rising claims tend to anticipate (by 1-2 months) upward moves in the unemployment rate and downticks in consumer sentiment.
- Highly correlated with US NFPs and JOLTS quit rates.

4. US PPI (YoY & MoM) – May

Identified Trends:
- YoY PPI is accelerating (2.2% in April to an expected 2.5% in May), but the MoM print is decelerating (0.5% to 0.2%).
- Indicates a transition from wholesale-level price shocks to a possible stabilization in forward cost pressures.

Change Points:
- The abrupt drop in MoM PPI is a meaningful potential inflection, especially if sustained for multiple months—suggests inflation pipeline bottlenecks are easing.

Relevant Patterns:
- Wholesale inflation leads consumer inflation by 1-3 months. Peaks and troughs in PPI often predate similar inflections in CPI.

Observed Correlations:
- A close positive lead-lag correlation with goods CPI, ISM Prices Paid.
- When PPI MoM surprises (up or down), US 2-year yields and the Dollar Index react strongly within minutes.

5. US Core CPI (Ex-Food/Energy) – May

Identified Trends:
- Gradual deceleration: 3.6% YoY (April) to a projected 3.5% (May); MoM holding at 0.3%.
- Core inflation remains persistently above 3%, reflecting ongoing shelter and services price stickiness.

Change Points:
- No sharp break yet, but successive slight declines are solidifying a slow disinflation process since late 2023.

Relevant Patterns:
- Core inflation readings below 0.2% MoM are inflection triggers for aggressive dovish Fed repricing.

Observed Correlations:
- High positive correlation with the Federal Reserve’s “supercore” inflation and PCE index.
- Moves in Core CPI sway Fed Funds Futures, US 2-year/5-year yields, and are inversely correlated with risk premiums (VIX).

6. China Balance of Trade – May

Identified Trends:
- Ongoing robust trade surplus (~$70bn); however, both export and import growth are projected to slow (exports: 8.6%→6.5%, imports: 6.8%→4.5%).
- Pattern of resilient external demand with modest internal moderation.

Change Points:
- A drop in import growth signals early-stage softening of domestic Chinese demand, which, if persistent, flags slowdowns in Asia ex-China.

Relevant Patterns:
- Monthly trade surpluses over $65bn consistently support CNY, while sub-$60bn records (or sharp export drops) correlate with EM risk aversion.

Observed Correlations:
- Strong trade figures support global commodity prices and EM risk proxies (AUD, copper, EM equities).
- Weakness is often a lead indicator of global manufacturing downshifts (Germany/South Korea trade).

7. UK Unemployment & Wage Data – Apr

Identified Trends:
- Unemployment rising slightly (from 4.3% to 4.4%), indicating labor market cooling.
- Wage growth remains elevated (5.7%), showing “sticky” labor costs despite a softer jobs environment.

Change Points:
- Incremental rise in unemployment rates this year signals a turning point from the tightest levels in 2023.

Relevant Patterns:
- Dislocation between wage growth and jobless rates: typically, rising unemployment tempers wage inflation, but stickiness now attributed to sector shortages and slow labor migration.
- Elevated wage prints prolong BoE’s hawkish policy stance.

Observed Correlations:
- Wage growth and GBP have a strong positive correlation; higher pay prints delay BoE easing and buoy the pound.
- Co-movement with UK CPI strengthens during periods of feedthrough from wages to prices.

8. US Michigan Consumer Sentiment (Prelim) – June

Identified Trends:
- Sentiment index rebounding from a sharp May drop (69.1) to a projected 72.0 in June, but remains well below April highs (77.2) and pre-pandemic norms.

Change Points:
- May saw the steepest one-month decline since 2022, a critical warning for discretionary spending.

Relevant Patterns:
- Consumer sentiment often leads or coincides with retail sales inflection points.
- Political/election macro headlines and gas price surges amplify results.

Observed Correlations:
- Strong correlation with Conference Board Consumer Confidence and retail sales outcomes.
- Lower sentiment tends to front-run equity sector rotations (from consumer discretionary to staples/utilities).

9. Brazil Inflation Rate (IPCA) – May

Identified Trends:
- CPI is gently rising (3.7%→3.9% YoY) but remains comfortably within the BCB’s target corridor; MoM at 0.3% is not concerning.
- Core and structural inflation remain in check compared to other EMs.

Change Points:
- A second consecutive rise would raise medium-term inflation caution; risk of a pivot slower easing if trend continues.

Relevant Patterns:
- Higher inflation has regularly interrupted or reduced the pace of BCB rate cuts over the last 18 months.

Observed Correlations:
- BRL strengthens with higher-than-expected inflation prints (on hawkish expectations); Bovespa (equities) more sensitive to inflation-growth tradeoffs.

10. Japan PPI (YoY & MoM) – May

Identified Trends:
- Upward move in YoY PPI (1.9%→2.4%) and stable-positive MoM (staying around 0.2-0.3%) signals strengthening in upstream price pressures.

Change Points:
- Rising PPI after a flat Q1 2024 flags a prelude to higher Japanese CPI; BoJ watching closely as it assesses conditions for further normalization.

Relevant Patterns:
- JPY has tended to firm following high PPI (expectation of BoJ tightening), but only if CPI and wage data confirm pass-through.

Observed Correlations:
- PPI reflects and amplifies movements in imported energy/commodity prices, swapped into JPY terms.
- Upward PPI surprises pressure JGBs (bonds), trigger JPY rallies when accompanied by BoJ hawkish commentary.

Emerging Cross-Indicator Patterns:
- Inflation indicators across US, Brazil, and Japan are stabilizing but remain above-target, often influencing central bank timing on rate cuts/hikes.
- Labor market softening (US jobless, UK unemployment) is now a developing global trend, although wage dynamics remain sticky – a phenomenon especially prevalent in the UK.
- Global risk assets are primed to respond positively to signs of abating US inflation (CPI/PPI), while EM assets hinge on China growth and commodity cycles.
- Sentiment and summit (G7) derived volatility tends to be transitory, except where linked to fresh fiscal, sanctions, or military policy.

Change Points and Opportunity/Risk Hotspots:
- Major US inflation releases (May CPI, Core, and PPI) hold the greatest near-term market-moving potential. Any deviation (especially soft MoM prints) will reprice Fed trajectory, prompting risk-allocation pivots.
- Watch the four-week trend in US jobless claims—should surpass 240k, it signals higher risk of labor softening headwinds for US growth.
- UK wage stickiness presents upward risk for both GBP and rates unless jobless growth accelerates.
- China import trends and global risk appetite remain tightly entwined; a sharp drop in imports would be a warning for EM assets and global manufacturing.
- Brazil’s inflation path will set the tone for BCB policy, with two consecutive upticks raising risks to easing.

Conclusion:

The coming week features critical US inflation data, global labor market readings, and significant trade/consumer prints that will shape central bank outlooks and risk asset performance. Key trends suggest broad-based (though slow) disinflation, early signs of global labor softening, and persistent external demand for China, with underlying risks tied to policy missteps or adverse geopolitical G7 outcomes.

Market opportunities lie in risk-on trades if US inflation underperforms, yield curve steepeners, and EM/local asset positions responsive to China/Brazil releases. Risks center on upside inflation surprises (slamming risk assets and raising yields), hawkish labor/wage outturns (UK, US), and shock G7/geopolitical announcements, each capable of abrupt sentiment shifts.

Continuous monitoring of indicator trends, change points, and cross-asset correlations is essential for tactical positioning and risk management in this volatile, event-driven environment.
